Le but de ce challenge est de déchiffrer les chaînes de caractères données.

Première chaîne : c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
Réponse : can you capture the flag? 
// intuitif

Seconde chaîne : 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 
01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001
Réponse : lets try some binary out! 
// code en binaire

Troisième chaîne : MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======
Réponse : base32 is super common in CTF's 
// les caractères '=' en fin de chaîne sont propres aux codes
// en base 32 ou base 64. Les lettres sont tous en majuscules
// il s'agit donc de la base 32

Quatrième chaîne : RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==
Réponse : Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.
// Etant données les remarques pour la chaîne précédente
// il s'agit ici d'un code en base 64

Cinquième chaîne : 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f
Réponse : hexadecimal or base16?
// Ma première intuition était un code en hexadecimal 
// j'ai donc utilisé le module Decoder de l'outil Burp Suite pour décoder la châine
// il s'agit donc bien d'un code en hexadecimal à traduire en code ascii

Sixième chaîne : Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!
Réponse : Rotate me 13 places!
// Je ne connaissais pas ce type de codage
// Je me suis documentée et ai appris l'existence du chiffrage ROT-13 qui est un chifrement
// par décalage de 13 décalage

Septième chaîne : *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX
Réponse : You spin me right round baby right round (47 times)
// Idem que la chaîne mais avec un décalage de 47 caractères
// il s'agit donc d'une chaîne codé par ROT-47

Huitième chaîne : 
- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -.

. -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.

Réponse : TELECOMMUNICATION ENCODING
// On reconnaît tout de suite le morse !

Neuvième chaîne : 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68
Réponse : Unpack this BCD
// On peut souptionner un code décimal 
// c'est correct !
